The Arena is a simple turn-based fighting game written using jQuery and Underscore. I worked in a team of three to create this application. It was also my introduction to Prototypes and Contructors and Test-Driven Development using Chai. I handled most of the functionality of the game including randomly generated enemies who produce randomly generated attacks that randomly hit or miss and inflict a random amount of damage.
